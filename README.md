# Amnesia Dashboard
The Amnesia Dashboard is a Windows application that provides quick and easy access to tools required for modding in Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

This is my first project using C# so the code has issues. It's not following sufficient naming conventions, I could have used different class types etc. There's much room for improvement, but this was the project I created years ago and used as a tool to learn C# when coming from a VB background and generally new to programming as a whole.
